## Introduction

In this project we are asked to record the hardware specification of each node
and monitor each node resource, e.g. CPU/Memory usage, in real time, in a Linux
cluster of 10 nodes/servers connected through a switch.     

## Architecture and Design
1) Draw a cluster diagram with three Linux hosts, a DB, and agents (use draw.io website)
2) Describe tables (no SQL code, just explain their usage)
3) Describe scripts (no code, just explain their usage)

## Usage
1) how to init database and tables (e.g. ddl.sql)
2) `host_info.sh` usage
3) `host_usage.sh` usage
4) crontab setup

## Improvements
Write at least three things you want to improve
e.g.
1) handle hardware update
